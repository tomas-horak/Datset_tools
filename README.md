Dataset utils

This is a simple library for grouping tools, that could be useful when creating ML datasets.
This library is work in progress.

Provided tooling:

Downloading images from various APIs
Decomposing datasets -> from a single dataset file with images and csv to folders with correct images
Creating datasets -> opposite function of Decomposing
Removing duplicates in folder by hash (TODO)
Resizing images
Creating tf or HDF5 datasets (TODO)
